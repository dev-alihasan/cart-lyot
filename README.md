#### This repository contains HTML and CSS code for a webpage layout. Below is an overview of the structure and functionality provided by the code.

## Overview

The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the webpage, while the CSS file (index.css) provides styling for the elements. The webpage appears to be a product detail page or a shopping interface, with various elements such as a shopping basket, navigation icons, buttons, and product information.
HTML Structure

1. The HTML file starts with the usual <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and contains a head section where metadata and stylesheets are linked.
2. Within the body tag, there's a div with the class desktop-1 that serves as the container for the entire webpage.
3. Inside desktop-1, there's a frame-a div containing the main content of the page.
4. The main content includes elements like a shopping basket, navigation icons, buttons, and product information.

## CSS Styling

1. The CSS file provides styling for various elements of the webpage.
2. It defines custom properties for fonts, font sizes, colors, paddings, and border radiuses.
3. Selectors are used to target specific elements and apply styling rules. For example:
4. shopping-basket-star targets the shopping basket icon.
5. size-btn-parent styles the container for size selection buttons.
6. but-btn styles the buy now button.
7. Media queries are used to adjust the styling for different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive layout.

## Usage

To use this code, simply include the HTML and CSS files in your project and adjust the content and styling as needed.
Compatibility

The code should be compatible with modern web browsers and devices. However, thorough testing across different browsers and screen sizes is recommended for optimal performance.
Credits
